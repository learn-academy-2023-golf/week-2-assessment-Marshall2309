# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: The parameter is the boundary of an element. The argument is the value of it. 

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable that is defined as part of the function's declaration. It's a placeholder for the value. The argument, is the actual value or expression that is passed to the function when it is called.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: Objects contain specific key value pairs. They can be changed. Classes are reusable blueprints that contain objects.

Researched answer: An object in JavaScript is a standalone entity with properties and behaviors. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It's a template that defines the structure and behavior of an object.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: I'm honestly not quite sure (or can't remember) how to define it.

Researched answer: Iteration in JavaScript refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a specified condition is met. This is typically done to process a collection of data, such as an array or an object, where you want to perform the same operation on each element.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in your code, and they will still work as expected. It's like hoisting a baby grand piano into an upper floor of a building before the building is finished being built, so it doesn't have to be broken down.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: The spread operator (...) is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows an iterable (like an array or a string) to be expanded into individual elements. It's a versatile tool used in various contexts within JavaScript.

2. React: React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces or UI components. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook, and it's widely used by developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

3. JSX: JavaScript XML is a feature of React. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. JSX makes it easier to visualize and write the structure of components in React.
